<h1>ISSUES</h1>

- For the correct display of the tooltip, the background of the html page has to be kept transparent, therefore, only the components have a black background instead of the entire page. 

<h1>PLANNED FEATURES</h1>

- Implement our own tooltip instead of using an external compoenent library to solve the above mentioned issue.
- Add search history feature for the user
- For a particular searched username, we can suggest similar people to search for based on the followers and network of the originally searched person.
